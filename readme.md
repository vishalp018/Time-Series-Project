Cryptocurrencies are fast becoming rivals to traditional currency across the world. The digital currencies are available to purchase in many different places, making them accessible to everyone, and with retailers accepting various cryptocurrencies, it could be a sign that money as we know it is about to go through a major change.

In addition, the blockchain technology on which many cryptocurrencies are based, with its revolutionary distributed digital backbone, has many other promising applications. Implementations of secure, decentralized systems can aid us in conquering organizational issues of trust and security that have plagued our society throughout the ages. In effect, we can fundamentally disrupt industries core to economies, businesses, and social structures, eliminating inefficiency and human error.

In this project, we attempt to predict the price of cryptocurrencies for the next few months. Initially, we will work with Bitcoin data and may generalize the code for other cryptocurrencies in the future.
